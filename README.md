# P-Win-launch

**P-Win-launch** is a Windows tool, allowing to launch processes in bulk with various parameters. Designed for general use cases and software experimentation, this could be a great tool for managing multiple software tools. 

**Current status: basic code**

### Usage
This basic version supports two arguments `process` and `instance count`. Both are needed to be specified.
Example of usage in CMD: `p-win-launch.bat notepad.exe 5` 
This will open up 5 windows of the process `notepad.exe`.

✅ Ideas


**[WORKING ON]** Basic batch code, usable with CMD + needed documentation of usage


❌ Extended functionality


❌ GUI

I don't frequently have time or ideas, so I will do this project when I can and want. I am also taking this as an opportunity to test and improve my batch skills and explore the options of creating GUI based-apps.
