**Multilauncher** is a Windows tool, allowing to launch processes in bulk with various parameters. Designed for general use cases and software experimentation, this could be a great tool for managing multiple software tools.

✅ Ideas


**[WORKING ON]** Basic batch code, usable with CMD + needed documentation of usage


❌ Extended functionality


❌ GUI

I don't frequently have time or ideas, so I will do this project when I can and want. I am also taking this as an opportunity to test and improve my batch skills and explore the options of creating GUI based-apps.
